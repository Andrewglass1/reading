# Base Expectations 

Make a form of *related* elements of user information. Your form action does
not need to point to a real webserver. 

## Form Elements
* First Name
* Last Name
* Password with characters blocked out
* Email with validation
* A gender radio button (Male or Female)
* A group that allows you to select your favorite beverage: Water, Fruit Juice, Ethanol
* Submit button


# Extensions
* Take a look at form elements with a http request inspector to validate how
  parameters are sent to servers
* Add HTML 5 form elements to your form.
* Compare other types of form validation(JQuery, Prototype, Dojo, etc) with HTML5
  form validation.
