# Process and Design
Before beginning any website you want to have a general understanding of what the user experience is going to be. What is the general look and feel of the website going to be, and what is the goal of it? You need to prioritize your content by making some things bigger then others, or higher up in the page. 

You want to keep the user in mind, and if your main goal of your website is to sell a daily deal you should portray your content in such a way that the users eyes are drawn there first.

## The main points of this chapter summarized are to

* Understand your target audience
* Create a wireframe that allows you to see how a user is going to interact with your product
* Use color, size, and style to differentiate information and prioritize what is most important

# For the exercise 
## Create a simple wireframe using Gliffy.com.

* Go to file -> new -> Website / Software UI Design -> Choose Contact Form Wireframe.
* You will notice Gliffy does must of the work for you. 
* Explore the left hand side. Notice the form components, maps, windows. Most of the things you see on a typical website.
* Now Lets add some basic information to this exisiting wireframe.

### A Typical Store Has

* Map
* Contact information
* Store Hours

### The current template has none.

So go ahead and add this information to the lower left hand column of the site.

For an example on how to do this, see the resources folder for my completed wireframe.
