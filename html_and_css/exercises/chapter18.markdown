# Process and Design
Before beginning any website you want to have a general understanding of what the user experience is going to be. When a user visits your site what do you want to them to do while you have their attention? You need to emphasize your content and some ways of doing this are making elements bigger then others, or displaying information towarsd the top of the page. 

You want to keep the user in mind, and if your main goal of your website is to sell a daily deal you should portray your content in such a way that the users eyes are drawn there first.

## The main points of this chapter summarized are to

* Understand your target audience
* Create a wireframe that allows you to see how a user is going to interact with your product
* Use color, size, and style to differentiate information and prioritize what is most important

# For the exercise 
## Create a simple wireframe using Gliffy.com.

* Go to file -> new -> Website / Software UI Design -> Choose Contact Form Wireframe.
* You will notice Gliffy does must of the work for you. 
* Explore the left hand side. Notice the form components, maps, windows. Most of the things you see on a typical website.
* Now Lets add some basic information to this exisiting wireframe.

### A Typical Store Has

* A Google Map of their location
* Contact information
* Store Hours

### The current template has none.

So go ahead and add this information to the lower left hand column of the site.

For an example on how to do this, see the resources folder for my completed wireframe.

# Further Research
Upon completing your website and publishing it you will begin to analyze your users and determine your turn over ratio for whatever goal you are trying to accomplish.

One way to potentially increase your turn over ratio is by reiterating over this process and creating two seperate templates or sections of your website.

This is typically called A/B testing and is done by all larger websites. The craziest part is you will have know if you are on version A or B because they session based!

For basic information see wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing

Or see http://railscasts.com/episodes/331-a-b-testing-with-split for a detailed explation on how to implement this in rails.
