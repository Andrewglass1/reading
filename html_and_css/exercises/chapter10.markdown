In this exercise, you will be adding some css styling to
an existing html page. 

- 

There are already index.html and style.css files. Within the external
css file (style.css), do the following things.

- Change the font of the entire page to "Verdana"
- Change all the 'h1' on the page to the color "#ee3e80"
- Modify the paragraph tags to have a 'font-size' of "13px"
- Change all the 'h3' on the page to the color '#665544', 
  with a 1px solid black border and 5px of padding.
- Change the '#heading_two' to the color black
- Change the paragraph right below '#heading_two' to 'bold'

Within the index.html, using the style tag, make the following changes 

- Change '#lorem_ipsum' to bold, with the color red and underlined. 
- Change the first set of bullet points (top 3) to red. Notice that they have
  been wrapped in a div with the id 'paragraph_list'
