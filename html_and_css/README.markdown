## Assignment

For this book we will:

* Begin reading & working on Monday 3/12
* Submit the exercises you create by 3/16
* Complete submitted exercises and reading by 3/26

### Part 1 - Creating Exercises

Each of you will have one segment of the book (commonly a chapter, but
the largest chapters will be split two ways) for which you write the
exercises. We'll share these exercises and all complete them as we
read. You'll be provided a reference example for one chapter and
guidelines about timing, content, and difficulty.

The chapters are not order dependent, so the expectation is that
you'll read/work through the segment you're assigned, create your
exercises, then read and work through all the other chapters as those
exercises become available.

Details on creating the exercises are below. Exercises are due by 11:59pm on 3/16.

### Part 2 - Reading & Exercises

Read the entire book and complete all peer-designed exercises by reading group on 3/26.
