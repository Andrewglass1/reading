# Chapter 1

This chapter was about project roles. The takeaway here is that each role must
be clearly defined for a product.

# Chapter 2

The key takeaway is that when your product and project manager is the same
person, you're doing it wrong.

# Chapter 3

"This is more due to the nature of product management, which is all about
discovering a product that is valuable, useable and feasible; versus project
management, which is all about executing to deliver that product."

# Chapter 4

I thought it was amazing how well defined the user interaction roles were
defined. At my previous company, design was always brushed aside and that
caused a lot of product aspects to be flawed.

# Chapter 5 

"You need to pay your taxes and remember to dedicate at least 20%to headroom"

# Chapter 6

"But there are many people that want to be able to work 40 hours a week and
--most importantly-- leave their work problems at the office when the go home
at the end of the day. This unfortunately is not the life of a successful
product manager."

# Chapter 7 

I wonder what LivingSocials net promoter score is.

# Chapter 8 

I thought it was very interesting that the author use the pronoun "she" instead
of the general "they" for the user interaction designer.  Are user interaction 
designers primarily female?
