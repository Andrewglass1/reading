## Introduction

On Monday, 3/12 we'll have our first reading group. In general, groups
will be working on different texts of your choosing. But for this
first run, we'd like everyone reading the same thing.

Please purchase and read "Hackers and Painters" by Paul Graham from
http://amzn.to/wgWpXR . There are both paper and Kindle version
available for about $10.

If you've read it before, please read it again. Have it completed by the meeting

## Assignment

Create a simple markdown text file and, after each chapter of reading, record:

1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )
2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

We'll use these notes in the reading group.

## Repository Notes

Individuals notes will be collected into one master document available the week of 3/11

## Review Protocol

### Phase 1 - Individual

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your notes as `hackers_and_painters/individual_notes/lastname_firstname.markdown`
3. Push to Github
4. Submit a pull request

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

Here's how you might accomplish the above using GitHub and git:

1) Start at https://github.com/JumpstartLab/reading/ and click the `Fork` button in the upper right

2) Clone your repository down to your machine and create your notes file:

```
git clone git://github.com/your_github_username/reading.git
cd reading/hackers_and_painters/individual_notes
e mylastname_myfirstname.markdown
```

3) Add the text of your notes to the editor window and save it.

4) Push it up to GitHub:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Adding my notes for Hackers and Painters"
git push origin master
```

5) Go to your repository on GitHub and click the `Pull Request` button in the upper right

6) Give your request a title "Hackers and Painters Notes by <Your Name>" and click `Send Pull Request`

7) We'll merge the pull requests into the main repository before working on Phase 2

### Phase 2 - Group

1. Gather into your group
2. Pull the latest code from the master repository
3. Collate and distill individual responses(*)
4. Add them to the document for your chapter
5. Push and submit a pull request

#### Collate & Distill

The goal is *not* to create an exhaustive list of everything written by every reader. The goal is to create a comprehensive set of the best ideas, sharpest insights, and clearest explanations. The final document should probably be 1.5-2x as long as any individual response set, but it should not be enormous. Use your editorial judgement.

If it feels appropriate, cite responses using the `@githubusername` style, like @jcasimir for Jeff.

### Phase 3 - Reflect

As they're submitted and time allows, read and discuss the summaries.

If you find some quotes and insights that you really respect, consider decorating some of our glass surfaces with them.
