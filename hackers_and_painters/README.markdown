## Introduction

On Monday, 3/12 we'll have our first reading group. In general, groups
will be working on different texts of your choosing. But for this
first run, we'd like everyone reading the same thing.

Please purchase and read "Hackers and Painters" by Paul Graham from
http://amzn.to/wgWpXR . There are both paper and Kindle version
available for about $10.

If you've read it before, please read it again. Have it completed by the meeting

## Assignment

Create a simple markdown text file and, after each chapter of reading, record:

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )
2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

We'll use these notes in the reading group.

## Repository Notes

Individuals notes will be collected into one master document available the week of 3/11
