**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

 * This chapter explains what wealth is, which isn't money. According to
   Graham, wealth is something that people want. Everyone can create wealth
   especially hackers because they are creators. They create applications that
   people want.
 * This chapter also briefly talks about how to become rich by creating wealth
   and how startups choose what problems they tackle.
 * He also explains wealth in terms of leverage and measurement as a means to
   effectively creating wealth.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that surprised me was that startups choose problems that are so hard
that they are 1) hard to reproduce 2) hard for larger companies to create. This
protects the "wealth" of a startup. I always wondered how VCs decided that an
idea is worth pursing, so it is interesting to get Graham's perspective on his
selection process.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

The unanswered question is how to become part of the 1%. I don't want to say
that it isn't possible, however I want to hear Graham's take on the people that
become part of the top 1% of developers.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I argue about his numbers and assumptions that he is making about the multipier
for startup's, however I understand his point. Everything is not an exact
science in startups and there is always a part left to chance.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Creating wealth is not about creating money, it's about creating products that
people value. Wealth is the creation of things that matter.

1)	- A startup is basically choosing to work really hard for a few years, as opposed to working moderately for many years
	- Programmers can create wealth by writing software
	- To achieve the goal of working harder for more money, you need both measurability and leverage
2) I liked that Paul discussed the need for measurability and leverage within a company. I think too many people rely on their ability to work harder for a proportional benefit, without considering if their efforts will be rewarded. I certainly found that when I worked at a company whose employees lacked these characteristics, my motivation was substantially decreased.
3) Is it possible to scale your company while maintaining the ability for employee efforts to be rewarded? I think this is exactly the question that LivingSocial is encountering now.
4) I disagreed with the arguement that you should definitely sell your company. I think the rewards of building many companies are best paid out over time, particularly because most people who sell their company jump right back into another one.
5)	- Wealth can be created, not only distributed.
	- Working harder is certainly worth it, provided you have measurability and leverage.

### 1. Notes ###
* Startup proposition is to compress your career into a few short years.  All the work, money and time goes into getting it off the ground, rather than spreading it over 30 years.
* "to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars worth of pain"
* Wealth is what you want.  Money is the tool you use to trade for what you want.
* Distribution of pie is a crap analogy
* Chicks dig dudes who can make things.  Create wealth by creating something.  Not detracting from others piece of the pie.
* Measurement AND Leverage is the key.  Stay small, work hard, get paid more.
* Once you start down the path of startup, you can't stop, competitors will never stop, so you've got to be willing to stay the course the whole way.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I totally understand the use of working fast, but he's got a pretty strong view of it being be fast or die.  Like a shark that can't go under 55 mph or else it will blow up.  Also surprised that purchasers/investors are more interested in users rather than profits etc.  This makes sense now, but I hadn't thought about it that way. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> This doesn't have any cliff hangers really </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> not really </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Move quickly, work hard, hope to win the lottery. </li>

1.	All a startup means is that I want to work faster and harder then i ever have before in my life and complete 3 - 4 years of work in a about a month.
	2.	That the most valuable thing of an application is the users that have signed up for it.
	3.	How do you get users to sign up for your site and what are potential revenue streams for them
	4.	Even if you work as hard as possible I believe it may not always turn into results especially with a start up. Also building a company to sell is a personal opinion that I disagree with as I would prefer to hold onto my baby.
	5.	Work Work Work

* Summary
	* people work harder in small groups and their rewards are more tied to their performance. startups are a great place to work very hard for a couple of years for the potential of making a lot of money. if you can make things that people want, you can create wealth.
* Stood out
  * the first 5-10 employees are the most important in a startup. Makes sense because that's when you shape the direction of the company and those people hire more like them. Interesting to look at how LivingSocial shaped that way, then shaped differently as we had to rapidly hire.
* Question Unanswered
  * if startups are a way to get rich quicker, but they fail more often, over the course of an average person's lifetime do they end up working more time by going the startup route or by going the big company route. Yes one is safer and one is riskier, but in aggregate who wins?
* Objections
  * if you fix an old car and sell it for more you don't expand the pie. There is a fixed amount of money and somewhere down the end of the trail of that money someone has less money for you having gained money. I understand that you may have created extra wealth because you are enabling yourself to enjoy something more by getting money for something you made, but since there is a finite amount of currency you are not creating money.
* Takeaways
  * wealth is what you want out if life, not necessarily money, though it can be a means.
  * vc's pay close attention to barriers to entry in the industry

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Creating wealth is what you want to do.
- To create wealth, do something people want. And do it fast.

**2. What was one idea that surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That if you look at it at a high-level, work should be framed as doing something another person wants. By making others happy you find a better path to success. This makes sense, I've just never heard it framed that way.

Group sizes are tied to average ability. So a larger group opens itself to the chance of being average on the whole. I just never thought of the dynamics of a group much before.

At every decision point, choose the harder path because it allows you to provide a buffer between the competition. I thought you'd want to do what was easiest given the available resources.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Does it go beyond just making something people want? Does it mean more if a few people just love your product as opposed to more that want it? Which is better? Is there a difference?

What happens when a group is entirely made up of great talent? How do you maintain it?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

The most valuable aspect of a company in an acquisition is the number of its users. I think that's true in some cases, but often you see value in the product early on or perhaps the team. Acquisitions aren't just for users any more, it seems.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- There isn't a fixed pie. You can create more wealth.
- Large groups make one person's value more difficult to measure.
- Allowing people to make money and keep it leads to a more productive, better society.

###1. Summary
While money is simply a fabricated system for exchanging value, wealth represents the actual possession of valuable goods. As a productive enterprise, startups are best used to try to creat wealth by introducing new value into the world.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Startups are not just a phenomenon of the dot-com era but rather part of a long tradition of leveraging risk and new technology to produce wealth. Technology turns out to basically mean the "techniques by which wealth is produced."

### 3. What question was unanswered?
Creating wealth by adding value to the world is obviously an admirable goal, but the fact remains that a _huge_ portion of our economy revolves around things other than creating value, so the inequality of wealth can't be simply ascribed to meritocracy.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
While PG makes a good point that the quantity of wealth in the world isn't fixed (and thus people getting rich aren't necessarily doing so at the expense of others), it is still true that economic policy (and especially access to education) has a lot to do with the distribution of wealth.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Wealth equates to "economic goods" in the true sense; by bringing more goods into the world, you create more wealth
  * Startups provide a way to create great wealth b/c they give tremendous motivation and reward for performance as well as the means to leverage that motivation into success on a large scale.

1.
Wealth is not the same as money. You can create wealth and grow the 'wealth pie.'
In large companies, your effort is measured by the average, so you aren't incentivized to work harder.

2.
A single skilled programmer can make hundreds of thousands of dollars of value in a day, while a mediocre programmer can make zero or negative value with the introduction of bugs.

3. He defines startups as businesses tackling hard technical problems. Is there an instance of a 'startup' combatting a non-technical hard problem?

4.
Is a boss always a proxy for the customers? In a big business, bosses do control work, but it seems like they may be less in touch with actual customer needs.

5.
To gain wealth, put yourself in a position that has both measurement and leverage.
Seek out the harder problems for competitive advantage.
Numbers of users are a proxy for software quality.

## Summary
Discusses how to make "wealth" not money, where wealth is the stuff we want and money is just a side effect. He also proposes that the "big pie" (that all the wealth in the world is fixed) is incorrect and that people can create wealth that just makes the pie bigger.
## Idea that surprised me
That he's a huge libertarian. I've always been interested that the majority of Silicon Valley supports Democrats yet often have very conservative ideas about business.
## Unanswered questions
Whether getting bought is a good thing for a startup. He's so against the slowness of big business, yet recommends that start ups be bought by big companies.
## Objections/disagreements
I don't believe startups are the only way of working faster. And, working faster isn't always the best thing. MySpace emerged before Facebook, yet Facebook was a better product. It's much more important to focus on quality rather than just being the first out of the gate. Also, he implies that wealth is the only reason people want to develop new technology, which is quite pessimistic.
## Key takeaways
Efficiency is more important than speed, and efficiency can occur in both small and big companies.

## Summary

* Wealth is having the things you want and need - not necessarily money.
* Startups are earning all the lifetime wealth (and experiencing the lifetime stress) in a few years instead of over an entire career.
* Created wealth does not detract from the wealth of other people.

## What Stood Out

* Hackers are craftsmen who create wealth because their hands are writing the code.
* You as a hacker (or employee) create wealth for the company. Most companies are not set up to take advantage of this fact.
* Measure the value you bring, whenever possible.
* If you're in a job that feels safe, you're not going to get rich. (make strong moves?!?)
* Want to make money? Get past the early start-up phase, be profitable, and get customers.

## Questions Unanswered

* Startups are a gamble. What about the ones that don't work - what's the loss in value because you spent 4 years stressed and overworked with 16 hour days and only recieved wrinkles and ulcers as your reward?

## Summary

* the creation of wealth is inherently the creation of something that other people want, and that pursuit of wealth itself drives innovation and technological advancement

## What Stood Out
> "the answer may be that Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who had a lot of money to keep it" - _Paul Graham_

> "for potential acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you. the second biggest worry is that if they don't buy you now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor" - _Paul Graham_

> "if you can develop technology that's simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other defenses" - _Paul Graham_

> "to get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things: measurement and leverage...if you're in a job that feels safe, you're not going to get rich because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage" - _Paul Graham_

## Questions Unanswered

* none

## Objections

* this all seems to be pushing a fairly libertarian agenda, or at the least encouraging the pursuit of commercial ends that do not satisfy a need or belief in a greater "public" good.  not that there's much wrong with that for a book or perspective geared towards the idea of writing commercial software.  just observing.

## Takeaways

* wealth is simply what people want
* in order to be put in a position where you control the amount of wealth you want to attain or would like to create, you need leverage and measurement

		### Summary
    There is a difference between earning money and making wealth; you want to do the latter.

    ### Surprising Idea
    That given enough multiplicative modifiers, you could be (for example) 36 times more productive than you're expected to be in a random corporate job. I'm not sure that I could create the same value in one hour that I did in a workweek at any of my previous jobs.

    ### Unanswered
    What on Earth happened with the licensing deal for DOS that made Gates a billionaire? That knowledge is not universal enough knowledge to have gone without a word of explanation.

    ### Objection
    I'm not convinced about the absolute separation of wealth and money. It seems that if I'm in an isolated group of 100 people, and 20 of them want bicycles but only 15 can afford them, and I have the capacity to make 20 bicycles, then my ability to create wealth and my ability to earn money are two separate numbers. I just don't know how that scales to economies of national scale.

    ### Key Takeaways
    * In a small enough group, you can get paid for what you add to the team rather than for being a warm body.
    * Startups are a way to take the value of your output and wager it in a fair-odds casino.

- In startup, you work extremely hard but for several years as opposed to not working very hard for the rest of your life.
- Aim for millions of dollars - not billions. Making billions involves a lot of luck no matter how hard you work, it may still not be achievable without luck.
- Wealth =/= Money. Wealth is stuff we want like food, clothes, etc. Money is a way of moving wealth.
- There is no fixed amount of wealth - if you clean up your car + fix it up, you have more wealth but nothing else has changed.
- Job is an institution similar to college but you get paid instead.
- In software development, it is very hard to accurately judge how hard you work. Companies are not setup to reward a programmer’s hard work since there is no accurate measure of it.
- The smaller the group = the easier it is to measure their performance. This causes people to do less work in large organizations since it can be easily overlooked.
- Best way to protect your technology is to make it really difficult for your competitors to replicate.
- Getting users for startup is incredibly important - everything else comes in second. Cater your application to what the user’s want.

- Technology is the technique that makes a startup
- RUN UPSTAIRS
- Startup - n: Working incredibly hard on difficult problems when you are 30 times more productive and barely achieving your goal.
- At every decision point, take the harder choice.
- A startup is like a mosquito, and a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score
- It is easier to sell an established startup, even at an inflated rate, than an early one

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- The time quantum for hacking is very long, so startups have an advantage in uninterruptible time

It honestly didn't occur to me the huge productivity gain that working with a small team in a single office will afford in a startup

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

How do world governments affect startups when they primarily occupy a global space?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

I think in some respects we are still working from a finite pie, but it is more of a power pie than a wealth pie, and the power is given more opportunity to decide where and how the wealth gets made.
