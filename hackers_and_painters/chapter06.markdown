**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

 * This chapter explains what wealth is, which isn't money. According to
   Graham, wealth is something that people want. Everyone can create wealth
   especially hackers because they are creators. They create applications that
   people want.
 * This chapter also briefly talks about how to become rich by creating wealth
   and how startups choose what problems they tackle.
 * He also explains wealth in terms of leverage and measurement as a means to
   effectively creating wealth.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that surprised me was that startups choose problems that are so hard
that they are 1) hard to reproduce 2) hard for larger companies to create. This
protects the "wealth" of a startup. I always wondered how VCs decided that an
idea is worth pursing, so it is interesting to get Graham's perspective on his
selection process.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

The unanswered question is how to become part of the 1%. I don't want to say
that it isn't possible, however I want to hear Graham's take on the people that
become part of the top 1% of developers.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I argue about his numbers and assumptions that he is making about the multipier
for startup's, however I understand his point. Everything is not an exact
science in startups and there is always a part left to chance.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Creating wealth is not about creating money, it's about creating products that
people value. Wealth is the creation of things that matter.

1)	- A startup is basically choosing to work really hard for a few years, as opposed to working moderately for many years
	- Programmers can create wealth by writing software
	- To achieve the goal of working harder for more money, you need both measurability and leverage
2) I liked that Paul discussed the need for measurability and leverage within a company. I think too many people rely on their ability to work harder for a proportional benefit, without considering if their efforts will be rewarded. I certainly found that when I worked at a company whose employees lacked these characteristics, my motivation was substantially decreased.
3) Is it possible to scale your company while maintaining the ability for employee efforts to be rewarded? I think this is exactly the question that LivingSocial is encountering now.
4) I disagreed with the arguement that you should definitely sell your company. I think the rewards of building many companies are best paid out over time, particularly because most people who sell their company jump right back into another one.
5)	- Wealth can be created, not only distributed.
	- Working harder is certainly worth it, provided you have measurability and leverage.
