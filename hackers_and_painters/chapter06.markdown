**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

 * This chapter explains what wealth is, which isn't money. According to
   Graham, wealth is something that people want. Everyone can create wealth
   especially hackers because they are creators. They create applications that
   people want.
 * This chapter also briefly talks about how to become rich by creating wealth
   and how startups choose what problems they tackle.
 * He also explains wealth in terms of leverage and measurement as a means to
   effectively creating wealth.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that surprised me was that startups choose problems that are so hard
that they are 1) hard to reproduce 2) hard for larger companies to create. This
protects the "wealth" of a startup. I always wondered how VCs decided that an
idea is worth pursing, so it is interesting to get Graham's perspective on his
selection process.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

The unanswered question is how to become part of the 1%. I don't want to say
that it isn't possible, however I want to hear Graham's take on the people that
become part of the top 1% of developers.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I argue about his numbers and assumptions that he is making about the multipier
for startup's, however I understand his point. Everything is not an exact
science in startups and there is always a part left to chance.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Creating wealth is not about creating money, it's about creating products that
people value. Wealth is the creation of things that matter.

1)	- A startup is basically choosing to work really hard for a few years, as opposed to working moderately for many years
	- Programmers can create wealth by writing software
	- To achieve the goal of working harder for more money, you need both measurability and leverage
2) I liked that Paul discussed the need for measurability and leverage within a company. I think too many people rely on their ability to work harder for a proportional benefit, without considering if their efforts will be rewarded. I certainly found that when I worked at a company whose employees lacked these characteristics, my motivation was substantially decreased.
3) Is it possible to scale your company while maintaining the ability for employee efforts to be rewarded? I think this is exactly the question that LivingSocial is encountering now.
4) I disagreed with the arguement that you should definitely sell your company. I think the rewards of building many companies are best paid out over time, particularly because most people who sell their company jump right back into another one.
5)	- Wealth can be created, not only distributed.
	- Working harder is certainly worth it, provided you have measurability and leverage.

### 1. Notes ###
* Startup proposition is to compress your career into a few short years.  All the work, money and time goes into getting it off the ground, rather than spreading it over 30 years.
* "to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars worth of pain"
* Wealth is what you want.  Money is the tool you use to trade for what you want.
* Distribution of pie is a crap analogy
* Chicks dig dudes who can make things.  Create wealth by creating something.  Not detracting from others piece of the pie.
* Measurement AND Leverage is the key.  Stay small, work hard, get paid more.
* Once you start down the path of startup, you can't stop, competitors will never stop, so you've got to be willing to stay the course the whole way.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I totally understand the use of working fast, but he's got a pretty strong view of it being be fast or die.  Like a shark that can't go under 55 mph or else it will blow up.  Also surprised that purchasers/investors are more interested in users rather than profits etc.  This makes sense now, but I hadn't thought about it that way. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> This doesn't have any cliff hangers really </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> not really </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Move quickly, work hard, hope to win the lottery. </li>

1.	All a startup means is that I want to work faster and harder then i ever have before in my life and complete 3 - 4 years of work in a about a month.
	2.	That the most valuable thing of an application is the users that have signed up for it.
	3.	How do you get users to sign up for your site and what are potential revenue streams for them
	4.	Even if you work as hard as possible I believe it may not always turn into results especially with a start up. Also building a company to sell is a personal opinion that I disagree with as I would prefer to hold onto my baby.
	5.	Work Work Work

* Summary
	* people work harder in small groups and their rewards are more tied to their performance. startups are a great place to work very hard for a couple of years for the potential of making a lot of money. if you can make things that people want, you can create wealth.
* Stood out
  * the first 5-10 employees are the most important in a startup. Makes sense because that's when you shape the direction of the company and those people hire more like them. Interesting to look at how LivingSocial shaped that way, then shaped differently as we had to rapidly hire.
* Question Unanswered
  * if startups are a way to get rich quicker, but they fail more often, over the course of an average person's lifetime do they end up working more time by going the startup route or by going the big company route. Yes one is safer and one is riskier, but in aggregate who wins?
* Objections
  * if you fix an old car and sell it for more you don't expand the pie. There is a fixed amount of money and somewhere down the end of the trail of that money someone has less money for you having gained money. I understand that you may have created extra wealth because you are enabling yourself to enjoy something more by getting money for something you made, but since there is a finite amount of currency you are not creating money.
* Takeaways
  * wealth is what you want out if life, not necessarily money, though it can be a means.
  * vc's pay close attention to barriers to entry in the industry

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Creating wealth is what you want to do.
- To create wealth, do something people want. And do it fast.

**2. What was one idea that surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That if you look at it at a high-level, work should be framed as doing something another person wants. By making others happy you find a better path to success. This makes sense, I've just never heard it framed that way.

Group sizes are tied to average ability. So a larger group opens itself to the chance of being average on the whole. I just never thought of the dynamics of a group much before.

At every decision point, choose the harder path because it allows you to provide a buffer between the competition. I thought you'd want to do what was easiest given the available resources.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Does it go beyond just making something people want? Does it mean more if a few people just love your product as opposed to more that want it? Which is better? Is there a difference?

What happens when a group is entirely made up of great talent? How do you maintain it?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

The most valuable aspect of a company in an acquisition is the number of its users. I think that's true in some cases, but often you see value in the product early on or perhaps the team. Acquisitions aren't just for users any more, it seems.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- There isn't a fixed pie. You can create more wealth.
- Large groups make one person's value more difficult to measure.
- Allowing people to make money and keep it leads to a more productive, better society.

###1. Summary
While money is simply a fabricated system for exchanging value, wealth represents the actual possession of valuable goods. As a productive enterprise, startups are best used to try to creat wealth by introducing new value into the world.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Startups are not just a phenomenon of the dot-com era but rather part of a long tradition of leveraging risk and new technology to produce wealth. Technology turns out to basically mean the "techniques by which wealth is produced."

### 3. What question was unanswered?
Creating wealth by adding value to the world is obviously an admirable goal, but the fact remains that a _huge_ portion of our economy revolves around things other than creating value, so the inequality of wealth can't be simply ascribed to meritocracy.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
While PG makes a good point that the quantity of wealth in the world isn't fixed (and thus people getting rich aren't necessarily doing so at the expense of others), it is still true that economic policy (and especially access to education) has a lot to do with the distribution of wealth.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Wealth equates to "economic goods" in the true sense; by bringing more goods into the world, you create more wealth
  * Startups provide a way to create great wealth b/c they give tremendous motivation and reward for performance as well as the means to leverage that motivation into success on a large scale.

1.
Wealth is not the same as money. You can create wealth and grow the 'wealth pie.'
In large companies, your effort is measured by the average, so you aren't incentivized to work harder.

2.
A single skilled programmer can make hundreds of thousands of dollars of value in a day, while a mediocre programmer can make zero or negative value with the introduction of bugs.

3. He defines startups as businesses tackling hard technical problems. Is there an instance of a 'startup' combatting a non-technical hard problem?

4.
Is a boss always a proxy for the customers? In a big business, bosses do control work, but it seems like they may be less in touch with actual customer needs.

5.
To gain wealth, put yourself in a position that has both measurement and leverage.
Seek out the harder problems for competitive advantage.
Numbers of users are a proxy for software quality.
